# 🧠 HireHunter – AI That Hires with Heart

Every great team starts with a great hire. But behind every hiring process, there are stories that never get told…

## 💔 The Stories We Don’t Hear

> **An overworked recruiter** spending late nights skimming through 300+ resumes—only to miss the perfect candidate buried in page 27.

> **A qualified job-seeker** rejected without feedback after applying to 15 roles, wondering if their resume even got read.

> **An HR manager** trying to meet impossible hiring deadlines while juggling meetings, onboarding, and team wellbeing.

These stories are real.  
They happen every single day.  
And they are *preventable*.

## 🧠 Enter HireHunter

**HireHunter** is your AI-powered hiring assistant—built to reduce chaos, bring fairness, and give people their time back.

It’s not just automation. It’s care.

# 🏆 Built With 💙 at Airothon'25

This project answers the call to build agentic AI that solves real pain.

HireHunter is that agent—acting with purpose, empathy, and efficiency.

### ✨ What It Does

- 📄 Parses resumes (JSON input or drag-and-drop)
- 🧠 Ranks candidates based on role fit, skills, and experience
- 🔁 Provides an **autonomous recommendation flow**
- 📬 Suggests top candidates for scheduling
- 📅 Mocks interview booking (for demo purposes)

All on one sleek, judgment-free dashboard.

## 🖥️ Live Demo

> “Here are 3 candidates who match your hiring criteria. Would you like me to schedule interviews?”

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** FastAPI + Python
- **Data:** JSON-based resumes, hardcoded filters
- **AI Logic:** NLP and Agentic AI models handled through sophisticated back-end processes

While we used an open stack to move quickly during the hackathon, our architecture is compatible with Microsoft AI tools like Azure OpenAI, Logic Apps, or Semantic Kernel — which can easily plug into our agent loop. This could easily be extended into Azure Functions or plugged into Microsoft Teams via adaptive cards for internal hiring workflows.

## 🌍 Real Impact

💼 **Recruiters** can spend more time interviewing, less time triaging.

💡 **Candidates** receive a fairer, faster process—no more "black hole" applications.

🧘 **HR teams** get relief from the mental load of hiring under pressure.

> *“HireHunter helped me fill 5 roles in 2 days without burnout. It’s like having a smart assistant who actually cares.”* – Aarthy Gupta, HR Lead
